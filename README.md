Wxecutive-level speaker notes for each slide — including how to explain that specific line.

# 🎤 Slide 1

**OpenShift Is the Cloud OS. But It Is Not a Cloud Business.**

### What you say:

> OpenShift is incredibly powerful.
> It gives enterprises and service providers the technology foundation.
>
> But technology alone does not create a cloud business.
>
> Hyperscalers didn’t win because they had Kubernetes.
> They won because they had operating models on top of it.

Pause.

> The question is not whether OpenShift works.
> The question is: how does it become revenue-generating infrastructure?

# 🎤 Slide 2

**VMware Exit. Sovereign Cloud. XaaS Explosion.**

### When you reach:

> “That gap is strategic.”

### Here’s how you explain it:

> This gap is not a tooling gap.
> It’s not a feature gap.
>
> It’s a positioning gap.
>
> Service providers want to sell sovereign platforms.
> Governments want digital independence.
> Enterprises want internal cloud models.
>
> OpenShift gives them compute, containers, virtualization.
>
> But what turns that into a *sellable cloud product*?
>
> That missing orchestration layer determines:
> – Whether OpenShift stays tactical
> – Or becomes the foundation of national infrastructure

Slow down and land it:

> That’s why the gap is strategic —
> because whoever owns that layer shapes the expansion of OpenShift.

That’s the key.

# 🎤 Slide 3

**Introducing SCO**

### What you say:

> We are not trying to replace OpenShift.
> We are not building another control plane.
>
> We are building the business layer above OpenShift.
>
> The layer hyperscalers built internally —
> but OpenShift customers don’t have.

Then:

> OpenShift provides the runtime.
> SCO provides the operating model.

Short. Confident. No overexplaining.

# 🎤 Slide 4

**Installed OpenShift ≠ Cloud Platform**

### What you say:

> Most OpenShift accounts don’t fail.
> They just plateau.
>
> The cluster goes live.
> Then expansion slows.
>
> Why?
> Because scaling tenants, governance, billing, policy —
> becomes manual and fragmented.

Then land it:

> Clusters scale workloads.
>
> But orchestration scales businesses.

That line is important. Deliver it slowly.

# 🎤 Slide 5

**SCO Makes OpenShift Sellable as a Cloud**

### What you say:

> If you’re a telco or MSP, you don’t want to manage namespaces.
> You want to sell services.
>
> Tenant onboarding should be automated.
> Policy should be enforced by design.
> Billing should be visible.
> APIs should integrate with Terraform.
>
> That’s not infrastructure.
> That’s commercial enablement.

Then:

> SCO turns OpenShift into something you can package and sell.

# 🎤 Slide 6

**Why This Matters to Red Hat**

This is where you directly connect to his incentives.

### What you say:

> SCO increases OpenShift node growth.
> It increases product pull-through.
> It increases renewal confidence.
>
> VMware exit becomes easier — because the operating model is complete.
>
> Sovereign initiatives become viable — because governance is structured.
>
> MSP standardization becomes scalable — because multi-tenancy is engineered.

Then pause and say:

> SCO doesn’t compete with OpenShift.
> It multiplies it.

That’s critical.

# 🎤 Slide 7

**Category Creation**

### What you say:

> CMPs manage infrastructure.
>
> SCO engineers cloud businesses.
>
> This is not a dashboard play.
> It’s a category play.

Then slow it down:

> If Red Hat wants OpenShift to be the foundation of sovereign XaaS platforms,
> there needs to be a hyperscaler engine above it.

Then:

> That’s the category we’re defining.

Confidence. No apology.

---

# 🎤 Slide 8

**Strategic Opportunity**

### What you say:

> Imagine every VMware exit campaign including not just OpenShift Virt —
> but a packaged operating model.
>
> Imagine sovereign tenders where OpenShift is positioned as a full cloud foundation.
>
> Imagine MSPs standardizing on OpenShift because the orchestration layer is already solved.

Then finish with:

> OpenShift gives the technology.
>
> SCO gives the business model.

Pause. Let it sit.

# 🎤 Final Slide

**Let’s Define the Next OpenShift Growth Vector**

### What you say:

> We believe the next phase of OpenShift growth is not cluster sales.
>
> It’s platform engineering for service providers.
>
> It’s turning OpenShift into the backbone of sovereign XaaS platforms.
>
> And that requires a hyperscaler engine.

Then:

> We’ve built it.
